<!-- `` ### Add data to your Google sheet database - Add data to your Google sheet
that you want to render into your database. Include a column called `title`,
`description`, and `url` (with an url to an image) **Note: you must add at least
2 rows of data for `get_all_records` to work**. This is because it needs a row
column names, which will be the first row of your sheet. Here’s the data I added
to my Google sheet. Add whatever data and images you’d like. (You can copy and
paste this into your Google sheet; select it; and then click split into columns)
